## [0.7.0 / 5.48.0] - 2021-02-14

### Added
- sandboxed indicator for tray icons, the tooltip now contains [#] if enabled
- the trace log buffer can now be adjusted with "TraceBufferPages=2560"
-- the value denotes the count of 4K large pages to be used; here for a total of 10 MB
- new functionality for the list finder

### Changed
- improved RPC debugging
- improved IPC handling around RpcMgmtSetComTimeout; "RpcMgmtSetComTimeout=n" is now the default behaviour
-- required exceptions have been hard-coded for specific calling DLLs
- the LogApi dll is now using Sbie's tracing facility to log events instead of its own pipe server

### Fixed
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: elevated sandboxed processes could access volumes/disks for reading (thanks hg421)
- fixed crash issue around SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID observed with GoogleUpdate.exe
- fixed issue with resource monitor sort by timestamp
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: a race condition in the driver allowed to obtain an elevated rights handle to a process (thanks typpos)
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: "\RPC Control\samss lpc" is now filtered by the driver (thanks hg421)
-- this allowed elevated processes to change passwords, delete users and alike; to disable filtering use "OpenSamEndpoint=y"
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: "\Device\DeviceApi\CMApi" is now filtered by the driver (thanks hg421)
-- this allowed elevated processes to change hardware configuration; to disable filtering use "OpenDevCMApi=y"

### Added

### Changed
- reduced SandMan CPU usage

- reworked file migration behaviour, removed hardcoded lists in favour of templates
-- you can now use "CopyAlways=", "DontCopy=" and "CopyEmpty=" that support the same syntax as "OpenFilePath="

## [0.5.4 / 5.46.0] - 2021-01-06

### Added
- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE: Sandboxie now strips particularly problematic privileges from sandboxed system tokens
-- with those a process could attempt to bypass the sandbox isolation (thanks Diversenok)
-- old legacy behaviour can be enabled with "StripSystemPrivileges=n" (absolutely NOT Recommended) 
- added new isolation options "ClosePrintSpooler=y" and "OpenSmartCard=n" 
-- those resources are open by default but for a hardened box itâ€™s desired to close them

- added overwrite prompt when recovering an already existing file
- added "StartProgram=", "StartService=" and "AutoExec=" options to the SandMan UI
- added more compatibility templates (thanks isaak654)

### Changed
- Changed Emulated SCM behaviour, boxed services are no longer by default started as boxed system
-- use "RunServicesAsSystem=y" to enable the old legacy behaviour
-- Note: sandboxed services with a system token are still sandboxed and restricted 
-- However not granting them a system token in the first place removes possible exploit vectors
-- Note: this option is not compatible with "ProtectRpcSs=y" and takes precedence!
- Reworked dynamic IPC port handling
- Improved Resource Monitor status strings

### Changed
- SbieDll.dll when processing InjectDll now looks in the SbieHome folder for the DLLs if the entered path starts with a backslash
-- i.e. "InjectDll=\LogAPI\i386\logapi32v.dll" or "InjectDll64=\LogAPI\amd64\logapi64v.dll"

### Fixed
